 Summary of Observations & Insights
Throughout this analysis, we explored purchase behavior across different demographic factors using statistical methods and visualizations. Below is a structured summary of our key findings:

🔍 1. Purchase Behavior by Gender
Boxplot Analysis: Males tend to spend slightly more than females.
Distribution Analysis: Mean purchase values for males and females are close, but females spend slightly less.
📊 Sampling Distribution:
Mean of the sampled female purchases closely matches the population mean (8671 vs. 8675).
Mean of the sampled male purchases closely matches the population mean (9367 vs. 9371).
✅ This confirms the Central Limit Theorem: The sampling distribution mean approximates the population mean.
🔍 2. Purchase Behavior by Marital Status
Married vs. Unmarried Spending:
Unmarried Mean: 9210.43
Married Mean: 9187.20
📌 Standard deviations are close, indicating similar purchase variability.
Distribution Analysis: The spending distribution is approximately normal for both groups.
📊 Sampling Distribution Analysis:
Sampling distribution means for both groups closely match their original population means.
✅ This further validates the Central Limit Theorem.
📊 3. Confidence Interval Analysis
95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were calculated and visualized for both Married and Unmarried groups.
Visualization Insight:
The confidence intervals overlap, suggesting no statistically significant difference in spending between married and unmarried users.
🚀 Final Takeaways
✔ The Central Limit Theorem holds, as the sampling distribution means approximate population means.
✔ Gender-based spending is slightly higher for males, but the difference is not very large.
✔ Marital status has little impact on purchase behavior, as seen from the overlapping confidence intervals.
✔ The overall spending distribution is close to normal, making sampling-based estimations reliable.
